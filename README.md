# Search-Engine

This search engine utilizes the principles of pre-processing and efficient parsing of input data to allow users on the client-side to make queries as they would with a search engine and receive responses in constant time regardless of the size of the input data. My implementation was in Scala. 

This project was done for a class at Brown University, and as per policy, the code cannot be made publicly available. For the raw code and/or more information, please contact me at sahil_prasad@brown.edu. Thank you.
